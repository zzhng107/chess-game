Test plan for a fully implemented chess game

Manual test consists of three large sections

1. Correctly move every piece including capture
2. Move all pieces in incorrect ways

    * 1 and 2 could potentially be tested together by doing several bad moves first after which user should expect error message to pop out and then do a good move

    * several sample edge bad move cases might include
        # pawn move two tiles toward enemy without being in initial position
        # pawn move backward
        # pawn move vs. capture
        # queen, rook and bishop move across the enemies
        # all chessman move on ally

3. Check checkmate for king under various situations
    * create complicated checkmate situations


4. Play the chess as a whole
    * possible follow a classic match on the history
